If you’re buying from a small producer, like the lovely turkey I used from my mate Paul Kelly, you’ll often find these birds come with their own cooking instructions. Really good-quality birds do cook in a shorter time so follow the instructions if it has them. \r\n\r\nThis year I’m using a flavoured butter to give a bit of extra love to my turkey, and this is a job you can do the day before. Get your turkey and use a spoon to work your way between the skin and the meat. Start at the side of the cavity just above the leg and work gently up towards the breastbone and towards the back so you create a large cavity. Pick up half of your butter and push it into the cavity you’ve created. Use your hands to push it through the skin right to the back so it coats the breast meat as evenly as possible. Do the same on the other side then rub any leftover butter all over the outside of the bird to use it up. If you’ve got any herb stalks left over, put them in the cavity of the turkey for added flavour as it cooks. Cover the turkey in cling film and keep in the fridge until you need it. \r\n\r\nTake your turkey out of the fridge a few hours before you are ready to put it in the oven so it has time to come up to room temperature. That flavoured butter will already be under the skin so you’ll only need a few tweaks to finish it off. Halve the clementines and pop them in the cavity with a few more sprigs of fresh herbs like rosemary, bay and thyme. The fruit will steam and flavour the birds in a really lovely way. Take the fresh rosemary, pull off the leaves at the bottom then spear that through the loose skin around the cavity to hold it together and keep it from shrinking back as the turkey cooks.','carrot,onion,celery,herb',NULL,'2016-04-29 01:08:09',1,1,NULL,'Holiday','13:00','20:00','33:00'),(27,'Roast duck with spicy Christmas rub and Marsala gravy','•	1 duck (roughly 1.6kg)\r\n•	sea salt\r\n•	reshly ground black pepper\r\n•	2 heaped teaspoons of five-spice\r\n•	1 clementine\r\n•	6 fresh bay leaves\r\n•	for the gravy\r\n•	1 bulb of garlic , halved across the middle\r\n•	2 carrots , trimmed and sliced\r\n•	2 red onions , peeled and sliced\r\n•	3 tablespoons plain flour\r\n•	100 ml Marsala','8475c80f994.jpg',NULL,'Remove any excess fat from inside the cavity of the duck, then using a sharp knife carefully score the breast and legs all over in crisscross fashion, roughly 1cm apart.
